Prof. Dr. Shashidhar R Joshi in presence with Asst. Prof. Babu R Dawadi, LICT Co-Chairman and Asst. Prof. Dr. Basant Joshi, LICT Member, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Nepal Telecommunications Aughority (NTA) to carryout research on “interference effects while allocating frequencies on recent technologies like 5G and Short Range Derices (SRDs)”. The MoU was signed on Jan. 25, 2021 at NTA premises. Chairman of NTA Mr. Purushottam Khanal has highlighted the possible collaborations in the future with the continuation of this resaerch so that the country will be benefitted with such industry-academia collaboration. “NTA can suffport to researchers who engaged in the filed of ICT at the university research that contributes to the Nepal’s ICT sector”, said by Chairman Mr. Khanal.  Similarly, Director of Technology Research Section Mr. Ambar Sthapit and Deputy Director Dr. Pradip Poudyal have shown their commitment to see the possible resaerch collaborations with IOE in the long run to boostup Nepal’s ICT sector. \r\n\r\n##Scope of Work\r\nFollowing are the main scope of works which are defined to fulfill the objective of this research.\r\n\r\nStudy all the relevant plans/policies of Nepal government and NTA regarding national frequency plan. \r\n\r\nStudy the current spectrum distribution plan of Nepal focusing on 3G/4G/5G.\r\n\r\nStudy SRD devices and their frequency usage in the global scenarios. Then find the list of approved SRD devices by NTA with their frequency allocation if any.\r\n\r\nReview the literature on the world-wide 5G spectrum distribution scenarios and their interferences (basically of India and Region-3 countries).\r\n\r\nPerform virtual or field experimental analysis including NTA approved SRDs to assess the possible interferences in the context of Nepal.\r\n\r\nPropose suitable solution e.g. frequency band for 5G network mobile communication that might have least interference  with other bands and the SRDs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n##Objective(s)\r\nThe major objective(s) of this research shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n- To study spectrum band allocation at different networks of Nepal.\r\n\r\n- To study the impact of 5G spectrum band interference with other bands with respect to use of short range devices (SRDs).\r\n\r\n- To recommend the solutions to avoid spectrum interference in the context of 5G implementations.\r\n\r\n**Reserach Duration: 9 Months **(February - October 2021)\r\n\r\n**Principle Investigator: Assoc.

CASI is a research based projects implemented for the uniformity in admission process at all constituent campuses and the affialiated colleges of Institute of Engineering towards excellency by enrolling meritorious best students every year at its engineering education.\r\nThe enrollment software systems developed is running from [http://admission.ioe.edu.np](http://admission.ioe.edu.np) and is contineous progress in optimum implementation", "publisher": 9, "publish_date": "2021-08-02T14:07:22Z"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 35, "fields": {"title": "Real Time Intranet Based Entrance ExamiNAtion System (RETINAS) रेटिनाज", "body": "RETINAS is a research and development project initiated by Prof. Dr. Bharat Raj Pahari, Dean of Institute of Engineering (IOE), Tribhuvan University (TU) on 2012 with the objective to select highly qualified candidates by having sohpisticated computer based entrance examination system for bachelor/master level study at the institute. IOE is the government owned oldest institution in Nepal providing quality education in the engineering domain since 1972. However in the recent decade, other several universities are established in the country, IOE hasn't lost its popularity with its major features to have dedication on quality education to fulfill the world class education. As a public institution, it provides equal opportunities for all qualified citizens to enter into the university education. IOE has been conducting its entrance examination every year since 1972. There were more than 10,000 competitive applicants in the entrance exam of bachelors program. Hence less than 35% students were selected for the admission. The Entrance Examination Board of IOE massively conducts yearly entrance exam by planning four slots in a day and one slot consists of 240 examinees. Hence, it takes almost 10 to 12 days to conduct exam for about 10,000 applicants.\r\nAs being the technical institute, historically IOE is always ahead in the use of technology. The increasing burden in the manual processing of the entrance exam enforces IOE to step into the automatic exam oepration and result processing system. Since 2004, IOE developed automatic answer sheet scanning and processing system and started online based application since 2009. From the year 2014, IOE has started fully computer based entrance examination at its resourceful centers at Pulchowk. The fully managed and hassle free application system of IOE entrance examination [( http://entrance.ioe.edu.np)]( http://entrance.ioe.edu.np) allows applicants to simply apply and receive admit card with specified time slot from online registration system.\r\nProject RETINAS had been executed since 2012 and is currently led by dean of Institute of Engineering Prof. Dr. Triratna Bajracharya including highly qualified research oriented faculties of IOE. RETIENAS has the following features:\r\n\r\n-  It is an automated system for Application Registration, Processing, Verification and Admit Card Generation for BE/BArch as well as M.Sc. Entrance Examination\r\n-  The system also reserved the exam date and time slot for every applicants.\r\n-  Highly secured intrancet system is available at Information and Communication Technology Center at IOE Pulchowk. Students appear in the center and give exam from specified LAB and the computer.\r\n-  The redundant entrance examination servers (WEB,DB) are maintained and more than 240 client computers are dedicately placed at ICTC. Hence 240 examinees can appear at a time for the examination\r\nThe deveoped packages to conduct entrance examination is fully interactive client server based system in which the time between server and client is well synchronized. We implemented lamports timestamp with the cristian's clock synchronization algorithm to distribute updated timestamp from server. Since the system is on the single LAN (Intranet), hence the propagation delay between client and server for timestamp distribution is very little (in micro-second) that does not considerably affect examinees during examination.\r\nLICT team is continuing the research and development of the system to make it fully distributed and run on multiple LAN with the introdcution of CACHE servers to balance the load and incraese the concurrent access during examination so that we can increase the number of examinees in one slot.\r\n\r\n**Photos of ICTC Computer Labs:**\r\n![](/media/markdownx/c4be8abb-ed59-485c-8b4e-c1a4107579fd.jpg)\r\n![](/media/markdownx/c1993049-848b-4b9c-a174-f93323d17dbf.jpg)", "publisher": 9, "publish_date": "2021-08-02T14:12:49Z"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 41, "fields": {"title": "Elective course Development: Health Informatics(Health Informatics)", "body": "##Introduction\r\nHealth sector, being fundamental essence to an individual and critical with the mechanism of service institutions has been properly braced by Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The public health sector of Nepal has undergone significant transformations in e-health in recent years. The Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) adopted its e-health-strategy in 2017, setting itself the goal “to harness the potential of ICT technologies to improve health services, health governance and management.” Digital health information system using DHIS2, open source software to record, analyze, report and disseminate health management information system (HMIS) data has been put into use across the health institutions of the country. Selected facilities have even introduced electronic medical records for each patient, to enhance quality and continuity of care. Moreover, additional information systems are being linked to DHIS2 to build a one-stop national health data warehouse. Furthermore, IT solutions in various health related domain are increasingly playing a role in health promotion and patient self-management\r\n\r\nNepal has improved well in health care services in past decade or so. Every district and their local units are facilitated with health centers. Besides, private sector is putting effort to provide world class health services though their services are now confined in major cities only. Although government has initiated e-health plan, it has not been efficient so far as the ultimate goal of e-health has not been met. The major cause for this can be lack of proper training to the e-health practitioner who finds it extra workload to enter patient information into the digital system. Vividly, a health sector person without IT understanding or IT sector person without health practice in the health centers is profound barrier to the e-health implementation. Hence, in managing and building upon these changes, the health sector will need people with expertise in information technologies – just as the IT sector will need people with an understanding of the health sector. This also means that new jobs are being created at the intersection of health and informatics, both in the public and private sector, and those professionals with relevant skills will be in high demand in future.\r\n\r\nInstitute of Engineering (IOE), Pulchowk Campus has been producing sound IT engineers since its inception and these experts can contribute tremendously into the health sector. However, there is no collaboration between IOE, hospitals and ministry to solve the health-related problems in the Nepalese Society. As a result, the need of proper knowledge sharing between the medical domain personals, IT engineers and ministry personals seem indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Laboratory of Information and Communication Technology (LICT) of IOE with experts, professors and resources is submitting this proposal on Digital Health Research and Development to bridge the gap between academia, hospitals and the government.\r\n\r\n##Problem Statement\r\nBesides offering IT related courses in its undergraduate and graduate programs, the IOE especially faculty of Electronics and Computer Engineering has been working on scientific research related to health sectors. Every year, Pulchowk Campus, IOE engages in multiple undergraduate projects and graduate research. However, the research/projects done is only confined to the institutional archive once completed. Had there been proper collaboration with Medical institute, these research works/projects would have been put into practical use to enhance quality of the health services offered by the hospitals.\r\n\r\nHowever, IT students need to be familiar with the medical domain terms and recent trends in Digital health to properly solve the medical domain problems. Thus, there is a need to improve the curriculum, organize workshop, competition and exhibition of digital health related projects to enhance the capability of these students in medical domain.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the medical experts rather than following their original instinct in solving the medical cases needs to get familiarization with the recent development in IT sector and should be able to use this system to increase their efficiency.\r\n\r\nBesides, there are very limited IT related human resources in medical and health related fields. However, using digital health facilities need some IT capability. Medical and health workers lack proper training on using existing and new IT facilities, software and tools. The number of IT support staff to maintain and troubleshoot digital health systems is very limited.\r\n\r\n## Objective(s)\r\nLaboratory of Information and Communication Technology (LICT) has identified the main objective for addressing the stated problem statement as well as for improving the Research and Development activities in Digital Health as:\r\n\r\n1.

Examination Control Division (ECD) of Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University is the one prominent and most busy organization where it conducts several examinations throughout the year. ECD conducts bi-annual semester exams for regular and back exam of bachelor of engineering students having 10 streams in its four constituent campuses and ten affiliated colleges. Similarly, ECD also conducts bi-annual exams for masters of engineering programs having seven streams and 21 sub-streams. Hence tentatively, there are more than 16000 examinees in an exam including regular and back. Additionally, successful conduction of BE/BArch entrance examination as well as M.Sc. entrance examination is the part of examination to be conducted by ECD.\r\n\r\nExamination registrations of all programs, exam center management, examinees detail verifications, exam roll number and admit card generations, collections of internal, projects, survey marks and its processing/verifications, coding/decoding of the answer sheets, packaging, expert assignments, air and ground transportations and delivery of packets/question, tracking of packets, secure result processing and result publications, question setting arrangement, re-totaling managements, error correction and verification and many more are the quite challenging events continuously to be handled by ECD of IOE requiring more human resources and time critical management of all activities to adapt with the defined calendar.\r\n\r\nThe continuous increase of streams and examinees demand more on all other relevant resources making the system more complex for operation and management within the existing non-automated manual system environment.

Our main motto is to have localized ICT research for our country that contributes towards speedy implementation of new technologies in the field of information and communication technology for social transformation. At the different time frame, we members were involved in real time network configuration of telecom networks, ICT policy formulation including IPv6 migration, broadband communication, latest network deployment et cetera. It was also the major concern of Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) to formulate suitable policies and regulatory guidelines to transform the current network into new networking paradigms. The important part for our country is the identification of proper cost of broadband deployment as well as network migration for ISP and Telecom equipment upgrades towards IPv6 and Software Defined Network (SDN), Implementation for Internet of Things (IoT), network operation & maintenance and upgrade as well. Another major concern is the amount of energy consumed by networks. The increasing network size and continuous operation increase the energy consumption by the network devices. Because of this, the companies pay a significant percentage of their revenue to power their network infrastructures. With the rapid growth of smart users, IoT implementation and the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployment becomes major concern for the service providers as their sustainable business solutions. Considering the global pace of technology transformations, we need to take steps for our country’s network to identify its current status and apply suitable measures towards future smart life.\r\n\r\nThis seismic shift in the technological paradigm has encouraged the team to carry out practical research on the field of smart cities and the related infrastructure including IoT, carrier network and data analytics infrastructure along with evolutionary enablers such as IPv6, Software Defined Networks (SDN), cloud computing infrastructure and virtualization technologies. These technological enablers are critical in realizing a functional high-tech society that can lead to efficient service delivery, better communication and improved quality of life in the smart communities. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\nInternet and related technologies have transformed the way humans communicate. Rapid technological advancement, service proliferation and integration of innumerable services have made the Internet an indispensable part of our lives. Traditionally, Internet has been a means of communication between people. The technology and network enabled people to quickly communicate with each other irrespective of geographical distance. This network then led to the evolution of network based services in trade, finance, education, social networking, and public services delivery. Even conventional communication media such as voice telephony and short messaging services are becoming Internet-borne.\r\n\r\nLately, Internet and IP technology have taken another very transformative turn. Machines have started to get more autonomous as connected entities that can create and consume data. This traditionally human activity (of creating and consuming data) has started being done by machines in what is known as M2M (Machine to Machine) network. This phenomena combined with the Internet technology is also called the Internet of Things (IoT). This has created an unprecedented avenue of technological evolution and business opportunity. Concepts such as remote surveillance, smart cities, smart homes, societal automation are becoming a reality. This, combined with advanced data analytics technologies, artificial intelligence, cloud platforms, rapid expansion of next generation broadband networks (wired and wireless) for seamless communication and future-proof technologies such as IPv6 has made the dream of smart communities, industrial automation and automated public service delivery a reality.\r\n\r\nAccording to the gadget survey , within the last 20 years, the number of Internet users reached more than 3 billion. The number of connected devices is more than 7.2 billion mobile gadgets which is even bigger than world's population in 2015. The rapid growth of Internet users and ICT business in the world led to the exhaustion of IPv4 address space and forced the industry to standardize new addressing scheme having 128 bits, called Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). In the next generation networking infrastructure, every connected device shall have one or more unique IPv6 addresses. The vast size of the IPv6 address space has enough addresses to allocate to every such device coming up in the foreseeable future. IPv6 on the one hand improves the efficiency of internet protocol as a whole including routing, while on the other hand Software Defined Networks (SDN) improves the controllability of networking equipment with an approach to using open protocols, such as Open-Flow, to apply globally aware software control at the edges of the network to access network devices that typically would use closed and vendor specific firmware. The invention of these new concepts and development creates bigger challenges in networking for service providers to migrate their existing legacy networks into the software defined and IPv6 enabled network and the implementation of those technologies in broadband communications.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid growth of internet users, increased Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices and the trend of world moving to converged network environment into the mode of computer networks (IP based network), the researchers, developers and the networking enterprises worldwide are obliged to enhance the intelligence in networking technologies. For the realization of the dream of smart cities and smart communities it is imperative to move towards next generation networking paradigm like IPv6 addressing mechanism, Software Defined Network as well as implementing the IoT & Wireless Sensor Network and addressing the increased user’s demand by having high speed broadband communications.\r\n\r\nBeing the developing country, Nepal is a net consumer of Internet services and technologies. ISPs of Nepal are the distributors of technologies and services. However, the rapid changes in technology worldwide has raised the challenges and issues for the developing country like Nepal towards the early implementation of evolving and new services. The major hurdles are limited skilled human resources, limited purchasing capacity and lack of proper planning. There is also a need for proper and timely government initiatives to formulate the policies, laws and regulation as well as their proper enforcement to usher in desired change in relevant sectors of society.\r\n\r\nNepal has six licensed telecom operators and more than 60 ISPs. Recently promulgated broadband policy of Nepal is still in the initial stage of implementation while the sufficient study on technology migration, migration policy and strategy have not been set by the government. The change in technologies encourages and prompts the service providers to introduce new technologies and provide efficient services to the customers via technology migration. The migration is a gradual process for which proper strategy has to be developed by the service providers considering the technology needs, customer demand, Capital Expenditure (CapEX), Operational Expenditure (OpEX) and traffic engineering perspectives towards smooth transitioning. The transition period spans longer during when the service providers should have to move forward with proper migration planning with optimum cost. On the other hand the geographical distribution of \r\nNepal is unique in the world having highest peak, mostly covered by Himalayan, hilly diverse terrain and a small part of plain area. Difficult geographical terrain and scattered inhabitation makes it difficult to build communication infrastructure and distribute the technologies and services. Core network migration to IPv6 and SDN, broadband infrastructure deployment with proper policy to suit of those migrated new technologies and the IoT implementations are the major concerns for the service providers of developing countries like Nepal. Looking into the Nepalese context, the technology migration is in the early stage. Similarly the broadband deployment, cloud computing, IoT implementations together with the necessary policy and implementation guideline formulation are in the early stages. This encouraged us to undertake this localized ICT research for our country so that we find the current status of technology implementation and recommend for the future that helps the country towards smart life and reduce the digital divide. We also expect the research to provide important insight to help innovate and introduce new services with right technologies in an effective and economical manner.\r\n\r\n## Justification of the Study\r\nThis research performs the technical and economic analysis of the legacy network migration to Software Defined IPv6 Network with broadband deployment challenges for Nepal including IoT implementation and the security measure that the service providers should consider. It will focus to identify networking equipment status for their upgradability towards future networking, optimum estimate to migrate the service provider network with cost of migration and broadband network deployment and identify the IoT implementation plan with better security.\r\n\r\n**Technological Impact:** This research is highly assistive to the service providers of Nepal to efficiently migrate their current network into next generation networking paradigm like SDN & IPv6 as well as it comes up with proper plan and strategies for broadband deployment and IoT implementations.\r\n\r\n**Socio economic impact:** organizations and the citizens are directly benefited with the use of low cost and affordable new ICT services.\r\n\r\nThis research would also be helpful to the government agencies/regulators for proper regulation, development of regulatory guidelines/rules and future planning.\r\n\r\n## Objective(s)\r\nThe major objective(s) of this faculty research shall be as follows\r\n\r\n1. Study the current trend of networking technologies migrations including broadband deployment and the IoT implementation for future smart life\r\n2. Find the position of Nepal regarding Broadband deployment, SDN/IPv6 migration & IoT implementation.\r\n3. Analyze the future network transformation challenges and recommend the solution for Nepal.\r\n\r\n** Reserach Duration: 2 Years **\r\n\r\n**Principle Investigator: Babu R.

Approximately two third of the population is involved in agriculture, which constitutes 34 percent of GDP. The seasonal nature of farming leads to widespread underemployment, but programs to grow cash crops and encourage cottage industries have had some success over the years. Population increase and environmental degradation have ensured that the minimal gains in agricultural production, owing more to the extension of arable land than to improvements in farming practices, have been canceled out. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge for our irrigated agricultural sector is to increase water use efficiency to result in increase in the productivity of land and water in a sustainable way (more crops per drop per hectare). It is important to optimize the available resources to achieve maximum return. Towards this goal, new technologies need to be applied to provide an optimal alternative to gather and process information to enhance the productivity. Climate change and scarcity of water demand new and improved method for modern agricultural fields. Consequently the field for automation and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to achieve this mission.\r\n\r\n##Background\r\nLaboratory for ICT Resaerch and Development (LICT)-Information and Communication Technology Center (ICTC) has signed MoU on 25 Dec. 2019 with The Water Resource Research and Development Centre (WRRDC), Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation to carryout detailed study, preparation of detailed project report and implementation of the project report for “**Developement of Smart Irrigation System for: Optimization of Water Use and Increasing Crop Yield (SISO-WAY)**\" resulting with research work.\r\n\r\nWRRDC perceive that the research work would come forth with publications of national and international repute as well as conferences of national and international levels and commendable achievements of the study would emerge through successful completion of Doctoral (PhD) and Master of Science (Engineering) thesis.\r\n\r\nThe complete research work is conceptualized to be carried out in three phases.

Our main motto is to have localized ICT research for our country that contributes towards speedy implementation of new technologies in the field of information and communication technology for social transformation. At the different time frame, we members were involved in real time network configuration of telecom networks, ICT policy formulation including IPv6 migration, broadband communication, latest network deployment et cetera. It was also the major concern of Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) to formulate suitable policies and regulatory guidelines to transform the current network into new networking paradigms. The important part for our country is the identification of proper cost of broadband deployment as well as network migration for ISP and Telecom equipment upgrades towards IPv6 and Software Defined Network (SDN), Implementation for Internet of Things (IoT), network operation & maintenance and upgrade as well. Another major concern is the amount of energy consumed by networks. The increasing network size and continuous operation increase the energy consumption by the network devices. Because of this, the companies pay a significant percentage of their revenue to power their network infrastructures. With the rapid growth of smart users, IoT implementation and the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployment becomes major concern for the service providers as their sustainable business solutions. Considering the global pace of technology transformations, we need to take steps for our country’s network to identify its current status and apply suitable measures towards future smart life.\r\nThis seismic shift in the technological paradigm has encouraged the team to carry out practical research on the field of smart cities and the related infrastructure including IoT, carrier network and data analytics infrastructure along with evolutionary enablers such as IPv6, Software Defined Networks (SDN), cloud computing infrastructure and virtualization technologies. These technological enablers are critical in realizing a functional high-tech society that can lead to efficient service delivery, better communication and improved quality of life in the smart communities. \r\n\r\n##Background\r\nInternet and related technologies have transformed the way humans communicate. Rapid technological advancement, service proliferation and integration of innumerable services have made the Internet an indispensable part of our lives. Traditionally, Internet has been a means of communication between people. The technology and network enabled people to quickly communicate with each other irrespective of geographical distance. This network then led to the evolution of network based services in trade, finance, education, social networking, and public services delivery. Even conventional communication media such as voice telephony and short messaging services are becoming Internet-borne.\r\n\r\nLately, Internet and IP technology have taken another very transformative turn. Machines have started to get more autonomous as connected entities that can create and consume data. This traditionally human activity (of creating and consuming data) has started being done by machines in what is known as M2M (Machine to Machine) network. This phenomena combined with the Internet technology is also called the Internet of Things (IoT). This has created an unprecedented avenue of technological evolution and business opportunity. Concepts such as remote surveillance, smart cities, smart homes, societal automation are becoming a reality. This, combined with advanced data analytics technologies, artificial intelligence, cloud platforms, rapid expansion of next generation broadband networks (wired and wireless) for seamless communication and future-proof technologies such as IPv6 has made the dream of smart communities, industrial automation and automated public service delivery a reality.\r\nAccording to the gadget survey , within the last 20 years, the number of Internet users reached more than 3 billion. The number of connected devices is more than 7.2 billion mobile gadgets which is even bigger than world's population in 2015. The rapid growth of Internet users and ICT business in the world led to the exhaustion of IPv4 address space and forced the industry to standardize new addressing scheme having 128 bits, called Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). In the next generation networking infrastructure, every connected device shall have one or more unique IPv6 addresses. The vast size of the IPv6 address space has enough addresses to allocate to every such device coming up in the foreseeable future. IPv6 on the one hand improves the efficiency of internet protocol as a whole including routing, while on the other hand Software Defined Networks (SDN) improves the controllability of networking equipment with an approach to using open protocols, such as Open-Flow, to apply globally aware software control at the edges of the network to access network devices that typically would use closed and vendor specific firmware. The invention of these new concepts and development creates bigger challenges in networking for service providers to migrate their existing legacy networks into the software defined and IPv6 enabled network and the implementation of those technologies in broadband communications.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid growth of internet users, increased Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices and the trend of world moving to converged network environment into the mode of computer networks (IP based network), the researchers, developers and the networking enterprises worldwide are obliged to enhance the intelligence in networking technologies. For the realization of the dream of smart cities and smart communities it is imperative to move towards next generation networking paradigm like IPv6 addressing mechanism, Software Defined Network as well as implementing the IoT & Wireless Sensor Network and addressing the increased user’s demand by having high speed broadband communications.\r\nBeing the developing country, Nepal is a net consumer of Internet services and technologies. ISPs of Nepal are the distributors of technologies and services. However, the rapid changes in technology worldwide has raised the challenges and issues for the developing country like Nepal towards the early implementation of evolving and new services. The major hurdles are limited skilled human resources, limited purchasing capacity and lack of proper planning. There is also a need for proper and timely government initiatives to formulate the policies, laws and regulation as well as their proper enforcement to usher in desired change in relevant sectors of society.\r\n\r\nNepal has six licensed telecom operators and more than 60 ISPs. Recently promulgated broadband policy of Nepal is still in the initial stage of implementation while the sufficient study on technology migration, migration policy and strategy have not been set by the government. The change in technologies encourages and prompts the service providers to introduce new technologies and provide efficient services to the customers via technology migration. The migration is a gradual process for which proper strategy has to be developed by the service providers considering the technology needs, customer demand, Capital Expenditure (CapEX), Operational Expenditure (OpEX) and traffic engineering perspectives towards smooth transitioning. The transition period spans longer during when the service providers should have to move forward with proper migration planning with optimum cost. On the other hand the geographical distribution of Nepal is unique in the world having highest peak, mostly covered by Himalayan, hilly diverse terrain and a small part of plain area. Difficult geographical terrain and scattered inhabitation makes it difficult to build communication infrastructure and distribute the technologies and services. Core network migration to IPv6 and SDN, broadband infrastructure deployment with proper policy to suit of those migrated new technologies and the IoT implementations are the major concerns for the service providers of developing countries like Nepal. Looking into the Nepalese context, the technology migration is in the early stage. Similarly the broadband deployment, cloud computing, IoT implementations together with the necessary policy and implementation guideline formulation are in the early stages. This encouraged us to undertake this localized ICT research for our country so that we find the current status of technology implementation and recommend for the future that helps the country towards smart life and reduce the digital divide. We also expect the research to provide important insight to help innovate and introduce new services with right technologies in an effective and economical manner.\r\n\r\n##Justification of the Study\r\nThis research performs the technical and economic analysis of the legacy network migration to Software Defined IPv6 Network with broadband deployment challenges for Nepal including IoT implementation and the security measure that the service providers should consider. It will focus to identify networking equipment status for their upgradability towards future networking, optimum estimate to migrate the service provider network with cost of migration and broadband network deployment and identify the IoT implementation plan with better security.\r\n\r\n**Technological Impact:**  This research is highly assistive to the service providers of Nepal to efficiently migrate their current network into next generation networking paradigm like SDN & IPv6 as well as it comes up with proper plan and strategies for broadband deployment and IoT implementations.\r\nSocio economic impact: organizations and the citizens are directly benefited with the use of low cost and affordable new ICT services.\r\nThis research would also be helpful to the government agencies/regulators for proper regulation, development of regulatory guidelines/rules and future planning.\r\n\r\n##Objective(s)\r\nThe major objective(s) of this faculty research shall be as follows\r\n- Study the current trend of networking technologies migrations including broadband deployment and the IoT implementation for future smart life\r\n- Find the position of Nepal regarding Broadband deployment, SDN/IPv6 migration & IoT implementation.\r\n- Analyze the future network transformation challenges and recommend the solution for Nepal.", "background": "", "scope_of_work": "", "objective": "", "project_duration": "2 Years", "funding": "Funded by University Grant Commission Nepal (UGC-Nepal) with grant support USD4000 under faculty res", "estimated_completion_date": "", "other_description": "", "publisher": 11, "publish_date": "2022-03-18T05:49:37.040Z"}}, {"model": "project_management.status", "pk": 19, "fields": {"title": "Development of Smart Irrigation System for:Optimization of Water use and Increasing Crop Yield (SISO-WAY)", "state_of_project": "ongoing", "introduction": "Agriculture in Nepal has long been based on subsistence farming. Approximately two third of the population is involved in agriculture, which constitutes 34 percent of GDP. The seasonal nature of farming leads to widespread underemployment, but programs to grow cash crops and encourage cottage industries have had some success over the years. Population increase and environmental degradation have ensured that the minimal gains in agricultural production, owing more to the extension of arable land than to improvements in farming practices, have been canceled out. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge for our irrigated agricultural sector is to increase water use efficiency to result in increase in the productivity of land and water in a sustainable way (more crops per drop per hectare). It is important to optimize the available resources to achieve maximum return. Towards this goal, new technologies need to be applied to provide an optimal alternative to gather and process information to enhance the productivity. Climate change and scarcity of water demand new and improved method for modern agricultural fields. Consequently the field for automation and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to achieve this mission.\r\n\r\n# Project Area\r\nThe project is designated at Gauradaha Municipality-5, Jhapa (previously Maharanijhoda-3, Jhapa) where community based small farmers group cultivate around 50 Ha (80 Bigha) agricultural land in an integrated way.
